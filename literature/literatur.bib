This study aims to evaluate the performance of three AI-based search algorithms—Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* Search—in solving the 8-puzzle problem. The algorithms were implemented in Java, and their performance was measured in terms of solution length, the number of expanded nodes, and execution time.}

In computer science and artificial intelligence, finding a solution to a problem is prevalently thought of as a process of searching through space for possible solutions. In Engineering and Mathematics, on the other hand, it is thought of as an optimization process, determining the most effective or optimal solution to a problem. These narrow the search space and increase its efficiency. It chooses which has the least futility at each step of the search. In this paper, we classify the various AI search and optimization techniques based on their pros and cons. To make it easier to select a technique for a specific problem.},

Othello has roughly ten octodecillion (10 to the 58th power) possible game records and ten octillion (10 to the 28th power) possible game positions. The challenge of solving Othello, determining the outcome of a game with no mistake made by either player, has long been a grand challenge in computer science. This paper announces a significant milestone: Othello is now solved. It is computationally proved that perfect play by both players lead to a draw. Strong Othello software has long been built using heuristically designed search techniques. Solving a game provides a solution that enables the software to play the game perfectly.},

  date = {1999-01-01},
  abstract = {Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart invites readers to embark on a new journey into a land of rationality that differs from the familiar territory of cognitive science and economics. Traditional views of rationality tend to see decision makers as possessing superhuman powers of reason, limitless knowledge, and all of eternity in which to ponder choices. To understand decisions in the real world, we need a different, more psychologically plausible notion of rationality, and this book provides it. It is about fast and frugal heuristics--simple rules for making decisions when time is pressing and deep thought an unaffordable luxury. These heuristics can enable both living organisms and artificial systems to make smart choices, classifications, and predictions by employing bounded rationality. But when and how can such fast and frugal heuristics work? Can judgments based simply on one good reason be as accurate as those based on many reasons? Could less knowledge even lead to systematically better predictions than more knowledge? Simple Heuristics explores these questions, developing computational models of heuristics and testing them through experiments and analyses. It shows how fast and frugal heuristics can produce adaptive decisions in situations as varied as choosing a mate, dividing resources among offspring, predicting high school drop out rates, and playing the stock market. As an interdisciplinary work that is both useful and engaging, this book will appeal to a wide audience. It is ideal for researchers in cognitive psychology, evolutionary psychology, and cognitive science, as well as in economics and artificial intelligence. It will also inspire anyone interested in simply making good decisions.},
